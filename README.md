# game-of-life
 sample application is a simple Java implementation of John Conway’s “Game of Life.”16 The Game of Life is a mathematical game which takes place on a two dimensional grid of cells, which we will refer to as the Universe. Each cell can be either alive or dead. Cells interact with their direct neighbors to determine whether they will live or die in the next generation of cells. For each new generation of cells, the following rules are applied: • Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies of underpopulation. • Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies of overcrowding. • Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. • Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
